# Neighborhood Map - React Map

This project was developed for [Udacity's Front-End Developer Nanodegree Programm](https://udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

## Overview
The goal of the project was to use React, the Google Maps API, plus data from a third-party API, to create a web application from scratch. 

### Requeriments
  * Includes a text input field that filters the map markers and list items to locations matching the text input or selection.
  * A list-view of location names is provided which displays all locations by default, and displays the filtered subset of locations when a filter is applied.
  * Map displays all location markers by default, and displays the filtered subset of location markers when a filter is applied.

2. Run `npm install` at the project folder to install the project dependencies.
3. Run the app using `yarn start` after all of the dependencies have been installed.

## Important
This application uses API's from Google maps and Foursquare, and developer free plans are only limited to a certain number of requests per day so you may experience not being able to load content. Note: The service worker is only functional in production mode (try it on the hosted site).
